# Webserver

Provisioned AWS network and compute resources in the us-east-2 (Ohio) Region

Created a VPC, private subnet, route table, Internet gateway, security groups and elastic IP address

I included a user data script to be exected at the instance boot time which will install necessary software updates and the apache webserver.
